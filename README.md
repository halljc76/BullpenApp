## Welcome to the Bullpen!

This application is the standalone version of what will be implemented into the
main application. 

Players using the Bullpen can sign-in to have the capability
to add notes to sessions, identifying performance goals or future aspirations.
The goal for this application is to be a place where players can qualitatively 
reflect on their game preparations.
